This folder contains the codes necessary to calculate the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) metamodel of the following publication:
ADD CITATION
The python functions necessary to perform the calculations are contained in the file: PCE_calculator.py
The PCE coefficients and basis functions are contained in the subfolder: CSVfiles
There are two files with examples:
 (1) MAIN_EXAMPLE: is a jupyter notebook that shows very simply how to obtain the fragility curve coefficients from the PCE metamodel for a specific set of input parameters
 (2) PAPER_EXAMPLE: shows the calculations performed for the paper example.
