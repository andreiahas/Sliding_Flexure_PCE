This folder contains the codes necessary to calculate the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) metamodel of the following publication:

A. Silva, D. Pizarro, and B. Stojadinovic, “Displacement prediction equations for seismic design of single
friction pendulum base-isolated structures”, In Press.

The python functions necessary to perform the calculations are contained in the file: PCE_calculator.py
The PCE coefficients and basis functions are contained in the subfolder: CSVfiles
There are three files with examples:
 (1) MAIN_EXAMPLE: is a jupyter notebook that shows very simply how to obtain the fragility curve coefficients from the PCE model for a specific set of input parameters. We also added the results of the LR model for comparison.
 (2) PAPER_EXAMPLE: shows the calculations performed in the paper example.
 (2) DISSERTATION_EXAMPLE: shows the calculations performed in the Silva's PhD dissertation example.
